## Problem Statement
In telecom, customer churn remains a critical concern, directly undermining revenue and growth potential.
The top factors leading to customer aattrition are:
* Inconsistent service reliability
* Lack of service disruption notifications
* Unanticipated changes in billing
* Unaddressed customer queries


## Our Solution
Our vision is to prioritize customer-centric initiatives to enhance retention and drive loyalty, provide initial troubleshooting framework for support engineers, and optimize support operations. 
**SmartReach** is an Agentic AI powered proactive outreach system for the Telecom industry that helps anticipate and address customer needs before they arise!
It's key features include:
* Hyper-Personalized Billing Insight with next bill prediction
* Proactive notifications for service interruptions/ongoing outages
* Advise for the Support Engineer with Preliminary Resolution Steps to Expedited Troubleshooting
* Customer re-engagement via proactive outreach

### Technical Components
* **Google Cloud Platform** – Cloud services used in the solution:
  * Vertex AI Agent Engine – Provides fully managed, serverless runtime used for deploying and scaling AI agents
  * AI Agents – Each AI agent is designed to pursue its own goals and complete tasks through reasoning, planning, and a level of autonomy
  * BigQuery – Serverless, enterprise data warehouse used to store customer billing history
  * Cloud Storage – Used to store customer call transcripts
  * Pub/Sub - Publish/Subscribe messaging service used to receive events from in-house/external systems 

* **Enterprise Systems** - Entrprise Systems may be on-prem or on the cloud:
  * Network Performance Monitoring System – publishes outage events
  * Billing and Usage System – publishes usage and bill change events
  * Customer Call Log Analyzer Job – Scheduled job to trigger call log analysis

* **3rd Party Tools**
  * OSS Ticketing System (JIRA) - Service Outage ticketing system for Engineers
  * Twilio - Programmable tool used to send out communications
